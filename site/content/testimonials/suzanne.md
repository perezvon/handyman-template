body: Jim was great! He worked at his own time which was nice, I don't like having to manage other peoples schedules. He completed all of the tasks that I had including an amazing landscaping job and deck re-finishing in the back yard! I will be contacting him again for all future needs, especially in the winter! Thanks Jim!
