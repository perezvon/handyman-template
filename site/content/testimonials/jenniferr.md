testimonial: I think that we got a better fence than we paid for! Jim was a pleasure to work with. He was SO fast and responsive and built a beautiful custom fence for our difficult yard on an incline. He was even patient as we adjusted our ideas of what the fence should look like and redid some of the crossbeams. He and Anthony worked NONSTOP all day to put the fence up quickly, and he even came back later to adjust some of the posts to suit our needs.
